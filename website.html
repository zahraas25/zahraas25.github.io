</h1>

<body>
    <h2>What's the internet backbone?</h2>
    <p style="color : rgb(235,23,111); font-size:20px">The core of the internet where the largest and fastest networks are linked together with fiber-optic connections and high performance routers. These networks are usually controlled and operated by commercial, educational, government, or military entities. 
    </p>
<line></line>
    <h2>What's the difference between clients and servers on the internet?</h2>
    <p style="color : rgb(235, 23, 111); font-size:20px">A client is a user program that connects to servers to access services whereas a server is a sample of software or hardware that serves a specific service to its clients.
    </p>

    <h2>How are servers, routers, switches, work stations, and other hardware components
        part of the internet?</h2>
        <p style="color : rgb(235, 23, 111); font-size:20px">Servers receive, store, and share data on the internet. Routers have two main functions. one of them is managing traffic between networks by forwarding data packets to their intended IP addresses,  and the other is allowing multiple devices to use the same internet connection. a network switch connects the devices in one network to each other, so they can communicate by exchanging data packets. Workstations are things like laptops and PCs that rapidly perform complex, technical tasks like digital content creation and detailed analysis.    Network hardware Is an essential set of physical or network devices for communication and interaction between hardware units on a computer network. These components are what makes a network able to function effectively and efficiently. 
        </p>
            
    <h2>What's the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) model of networking, in general terms? How does this
        protocol provide the data transfer mechanism required to establish client/server relationships?</h2>
    <p style="color : rgb(235, 23, 111); font-size:20px; ">This protocol is a framework for organizing the set of communication protocols utilized in the internet and similar computer networks according to functional criteria. It specifies how data is exchanged over the internet, providing end-to-end communications that identify how it should be broken into packets, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received at the destination.</p>
    <h2>Examples of internet services that rely on client/server relationships:</h2>
    <p style="color : rgb(235, 23, 111); font-size:20px"><p style="color : rgb(235, 23, 111); font-size:20px">A delivery of a web page, online games, and username password login applications.
    </p>
    <h2>What's hypertext?</h2>
    <p style="color : rgb(235, 23, 111); font-size:20px">Hypertext, in simple terms, is text which contains links to other texts.
    </p>
    <h2>How's “the web” related to the internet?</h2>
    <p style="color : rgb(235, 23, 111); font-size:20px">The internet is a way of transporting content - “the web” is a software that lets you use that content, or contribute your own.
    </p>
    <h2>How's the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) used to facilitate client/server interaction?</h2>
    <p style="color : rgb(235, 23, 111); font-size:20px">After a client makes a request from a website server, HTTP takes that request and makes a connection between client and server with TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). After that, HTTP sends the request to the server which pulls up the requested information and gives it back. HTTP then carries the response back to the client.</p>
    <h2>What's HTTP? How does it differ from HTTPS?</h2>
    <p style="color : rgb(235, 23, 111); font-size:20px">HTTPS is just HTTP, but with encryption and verification. Https uses TLS (SSL)  to encrypt usual HTTP requests and responses, and to digitally sign those requests and responses. This makes HTTPS much more secure than HTTP.</p>
   
    <h2>Describe and illustrate the development of the Web in general terms using the Web 1.0, Web 2.0,
        and Web 3.0 generational paradigms.</h2>
        <p style="color : rgb(235, 23, 111); font-size:20px">Web 1.0 is the first iteration of the web, also known as the” read-only web” by Berners-Lee. It allows us to search for information and read it. In terms of user interaction and content generation, there wasn't very much developed for that. The net at that time was useful for people who wanted to make their information available to anyone at any time on their website. This web was the first building block for exposure on the internet.  It provided a means to present products to potential customers like a catalog or brochure would do to anyone in the world,  removing geographical restrictions. 
      Web 2.0, or the “read-write” web, as Berners-Lee described it, provided the ability to contribute content and interact with other web users. It brought significant changes across the landscape of the web, in a little amount of time. It introduced things like YouTube and MySpace, which rely on user submissions. 
      Extrapolating Berners-Lee’s explanations, we get Web 3.0, the “read-write-execute” web. Think of semantic markup and web services. Semantic markup is referring to the communication gap between humans and computerized applications. It is a great challenge to present information on the web because applications cannot provide contacts to data and can't understand what is relevant. Semantic markup data could be put in a form that's not only accessible to humans by a natural language but is able to be understood and interpreted by software applications as well. This is the”execute”  portion of the web 3.0 definition. Web services are softwares that support computer-to-computer  interaction across the internet. They're not new, usually taking the form of an application programming interface. Think of Flickr - It provides a web service whereby developers can programmatically interface to search for images.  Conjoining semantic markup and web services can provide a web 3.0 experience - applications that can speak to each other directly and translate information for humans.

    <h2>How are Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and Web 3.0 different? How are they similar?</h2>
    <p style="color : rgb(235, 23, 111); font-size:20px">Web 1.0 is the web for information that can only be read. Web 2.0 is a step up from this, where clients can participate in it. Web 3.0 is where users can read,  write, and execute on the web, making it a full package. This includes things like artificial intelligence, 3D graphics, connectivity, etc. All together, these versions allow the free action of spreading information across a number of people.

    <h2>Comparing and contrasting markup and scripting languages:</h2>
    <p style="color : rgb(235,23,111); font-size:20px">Markup languages act as a set of directions that tell the browser software how to display and manage a web document.
    </p>

    <h2>The relationship between Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), Extensible Markup Language (XML), Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Extensible Hypertext Markup Language (XHTML), Dynamic Hypertext Markup Language (DHTML), and markdown (MD), explained.
  </h2>
    <p style="color : rgb(235,23,111); font-size:20px">SGML, XML, and HTML are all classified as markup languages. The word “markup” came from editors making revisions to writer's manuscripts. The editor “marks up”  the manuscript to emphasize certain fields. In terms of computer technology, a markup language is a set of words and symbols that emphasizes texts to define it for a web document. These are a family of languages that help make websites functional and web design dynamic.  
      XHTML (Extensible Hyper Text Markup Language) Can be considered as a combined language that uses features from both HTML and XML. All the tags and properties of HTML are incorporated in XHTML. XHTML Is stricter when it comes to opening and closing tags, case sensitivity, and error finding. DHTML (Dynamic Hyper Text Markup Language) Was created with the purpose of providing interactivity to the web pages as HTML was only capable of creating static web pages. It provided opportunities for users to use interactive web pages more than normal web pages. It also makes it possible to return a response to the user's input without the involvement of any web server.  markdown is recognized as easier to write than HTML, and it's easier for most people to read Markdown source than HTML source. It is less expressive, however, than HTML, particularly regarding semantic tagging. HTML can achieve some specific effects that might be difficult or impossible in Markdown.

    <h2>Some of my own interests, values, beliefs, resources, prior learning and experiences.
    </h2>
    <p style="color : rgb(235,23,111); font-size:20px">Some of my personal interests include psychology and community involvement outside of school. I value being a helpful person and believe that implementing my values in my life is something that I will always strive for. I have had previous experiences along the lines of getting treated differently by different people and in different places. Things like this have always interested me - the way that people behave in relation to others. I always try to be observant of that, everywhere I go. I also think of my family as a priority, and I place importance on the progress of my physical, mental, and spiritual abilities and understanding.

    <h2>How CSE1210 could connect to my future occupational choices.</h2>
    <p style="color : rgb(235,23,111); font-size:20px">Coding websites is a skill that may come in useful later in my future. I could create and design a website if I ever go into business, or I could do this for someone else and get payed. Websites can be useful for spreading information and promoting things, and sharing news and ideas. Many careers and jobs need websites for this reason.
